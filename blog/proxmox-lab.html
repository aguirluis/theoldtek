<h1>Designing a Production-Style Home Lab with Proxmox, pfSense, and TrueNAS</h1>
<p class="post-date">Published: 2025</p>

<p>
  My Proxmox home lab is the backbone of all my testing, automation, and
  cybersecurity experimentation. The goal was to build an environment that feels
  like a real enterprise network — but running entirely at home.
</p>

<h2>Core Components</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Proxmox VE</strong> for virtualization</li>
  <li><strong>pfSense</strong> for firewalling and routing</li>
  <li><strong>TrueNAS</strong> for storage and NFS/SMB shares</li>
  <li>Automated VM provisioning using shell scripts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Network Layout</h2>
<p>
  I created segmented VLANs for management, servers, clients, and lab networks.
  pfSense handles DHCP, DNS forwarding, and firewall rules between segments.
</p>

<h2>Automation</h2>
<p>
  One of the biggest wins was automating VM creation. Using Proxmox’s CLI tools,
  I wrote scripts that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create VMs from cloud-init templates</li>
  <li>Apply CPU/RAM defaults</li>
  <li>Attach storage and networks</li>
  <li>Start and configure the VM automatically</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Lab Matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It mirrors real enterprise infrastructure.</li>
  <li>It’s perfect for cybersecurity and identity management testing.</li>
  <li>It saves hours of manual VM setup.</li>
</ul>
