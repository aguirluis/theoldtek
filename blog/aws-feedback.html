<h2>Building a Serverless Feedback Form with AWS and GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>
  I wanted a simple way to collect feedback without running a server, managing a database,
  or worrying about scaling. That led me to a fully serverless stack:
  <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>, <strong>API Gateway</strong>, and <strong>DynamoDB</strong>,
  with a static frontend hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Architecture at a glance</h3>
<p>
  The flow looks like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The user fills out a feedback form on a static HTML page.</li>
  <li>The browser sends a <code>POST</code> request to an AWS API Gateway endpoint.</li>
  <li>API Gateway invokes a Lambda function.</li>
  <li>The Lambda function writes the feedback into a DynamoDB table called <code>FeedbackTable</code>.</li>
  <li>The Lambda returns a JSON response, which the frontend shows as a success message.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Backend: Lambda + DynamoDB</h3>
<p>
  The Lambda function is written in Node.js 22.x and uses the AWS SDK v3. It parses the incoming
  request body, generates a unique <code>feedbackId</code>, and stores the data in DynamoDB.
</p>

<h3>API Gateway: Exposing the Lambda as HTTP</h3>
<p>
  I created a REST API in API Gateway with a <code>POST /feedback</code> method integrated with the Lambda
  using Lambda proxy integration. I also enabled CORS and tested the method directly in the console
  until I consistently got a <code>200 OK</code> with a JSON success message.
</p>

<h3>Frontend: Static HTML on GitHub Pages</h3>
<p>
  The page you're on now, <code>aws-feedback.html</code>, is a simple HTML form that sends a JSON payload
  to the API Gateway endpoint using the Fetch API. Because the backend already handles CORS and returns
  clean JSON, the frontend code stays very small and focused.
</p>

<h3>Why this approach works well</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No servers to manage:</strong> Lambda and DynamoDB are fully managed.</li>
  <li><strong>Scales automatically:</strong> It can handle spikes in traffic without extra work.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> You only pay for what you use.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple frontend:</strong> A single static HTML file can power the entire experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you submit the form below, your feedback is stored in DynamoDB in real time.
  This small project ended up being a great way to learn how AWS services fit together
  in a real, end-to-end workflow.
