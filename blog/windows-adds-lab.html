<h1>Building an Enterprise-Style ADDS, DHCP, and RAS/NAT Lab with Windows Server 2019</h1>
<p class="post-date">Published: 2025</p>

<p>
  This project recreates a real enterprise identity and network environment using
  <strong>Windows Server 2019</strong>. It includes Active Directory Domain
  Services, DHCP, and Routing and Remote Access (RAS/NAT).
</p>

<h2>Active Directory Setup</h2>
<p>
  I deployed AD DS, created OUs, and implemented a clean RBAC model for
  administrators, helpdesk, and standard users.
</p>

<h2>DHCP Configuration</h2>
<p>
  DHCP handles IP assignment for multiple VLANs. I configured:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scopes for each subnet</li>
  <li>Reservations for servers</li>
  <li>DNS and gateway options</li>
</ul>

<h2>RAS/NAT</h2>
<p>
  RAS provides routing between internal networks and the external network. NAT
  allows internal VMs to reach the internet without exposing them directly.
</p>

<h2>Why This Lab Is Useful</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Perfect for identity management practice</li>
  <li>Great for cybersecurity testing</li>
  <li>Replicates real enterprise infrastructure</li>
</ul>
